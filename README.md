**Sustainability** / **Best Use of Gemini**

## Project Description
**MyGreenMirror** is a web application that helps individuals understand the environmental cost of their daily choices. It acts as a personal carbon footprint analyzer, using Google's Gemini models to process multimodal inputs and provide scientific estimates of carbon emissions (CO₂e).

Climate change often feels abstract. MyGreenMirror makes it tangible. Users can upload photos of meals, record videos of their commute, or speak audio logs of their waste disposal. The app uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash** to identify items, analyze activities, and calculate an estimated carbon impact score. It creates stunning "Impact Visualizations"—3D isometric dioramas generated by **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image**—that abstractly represent the user's environmental footprint, making data beautiful and understandable.

To ensure accessibility, the app features a robust **Guest Mode**, allowing anyone to instantly analyze habits without account creation. Users can track their history, view community impact stats, and learn specific actionable tips to reduce their emissions.

## How I created it
I built MyGreenMirror using **React** and **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive, mobile-first interface. The core intelligence is powered by the **Google GenAI SDK** (`@google/genai`).

1.  **Multimodal Carbon Analysis**: I used `gemini-2.5-flash` to process user uploads (Images, Video, Audio). The model identifies specific objects (e.g., identifying plastic types), analyzes complex activities (e.g., estimating emissions from a bus ride vs. car), and outputs structured JSON data containing carbon scores (g CO₂e) and bounding box coordinates for AR overlays.
2.  **Impact Visualization**: To make the data resonate emotionally, I utilized `gemini-2.5-flash-image`. The app takes the analysis context (e.g., "High carbon meal with red meat") and generates a "3D Isometric Diorama". Low-carbon activities generate lush, green islands; high-carbon ones generate industrial, smoggy landscapes.
3.  **Frictionless UX**: Implemented a "Guest Mode" using local storage and state management, allowing immediate access to AI analysis. Guest data is seamlessly merged into a permanent profile if the user decides to sign in later.

## Why it matters
Understanding one's individual contribution to climate change is the first step toward mitigation. MyGreenMirror solves common barriers to eco-tracking:
1.  **Low Barrier to Entry**: With Guest Mode and Multimodal input (Voice/Camera), users don't need to type or sign up to get immediate value.
2.  **Making the Invisible Visible**: Carbon footprint is usually just a number. We turn it into specific, bounded object detection and generative art, helping users visualize the "weight" of their choices.
3.  **Educational & Actionable**: Beyond just tracking, the app provides specific, AI-generated tips (e.g., "This container is compostable, not recyclable") to correct behavior in real-time.
